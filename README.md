## :computer: How does it work?

### Platform
With EscrevaMe(WriteMe), the user can register and share their essays/compositions, interacting with other users.

### Register (Sign Up)
Users can register themselves with the JoinUsPage component, choosing one of the Sign Up methods.

After registration, users are redirected to their user pages (UserPage component).

#### Details
- The system identifies valid and invalid e-mails, allowing the registration only with valid e-mails.
- The system identifies if the data entered is already being used. If the data entered is already being used by other users, registration will not be allowed.
